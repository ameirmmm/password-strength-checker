# Password Strength Checker 🚀

A simple space-themed password strength checker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The app scores a password in real time and shows which requirements are met using a checklist and a strength meter.

## What it does
- Gives a score from 0–100
- Shows strength level (Weak / Okay / Strong / Very Strong)
- Checks for:
  - 12+ characters
  - uppercase and lowercase letters
  - numbers
  - symbols
  - no spaces
  - common password detection

## Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Running the project
Open `index.html` in your browser or run it using Live Server in VS Code.
This is my first mini-web project and it was built to practice JavaScript logic and real-time UI updates.
